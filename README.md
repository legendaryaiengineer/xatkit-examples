[![Wiki Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/doc-wiki-blue)](https://github.com/xatkit-bot-platform/xatkit-releases/wiki)

Example Bots built with the Xatkit framework

## Installation

The bots in this repository work with the [latest version of Xatkit](https://github.com/xatkit-bot-platform/xatkit), unless stated explicitly in the bot directory's README. Installing the Eclipse plugins is not required to execute the bot, but needed to open/edit their execution models and intent libraries with the Xatkit language auto-completion, syntax highlighting and other advanced IDE features.

## Running a Bot Example

These example bots are run as any other bot. You can read [our getting started guide](https://github.com/xatkit-bot-platform/xatkit/wiki/Getting-Started) 
and our instructions for [configuring](https://github.com/xatkit-bot-platform/xatkit/wiki/Xatkit-Options) and deploying bots, e.g. in 
[Slack](https://github.com/xatkit-bot-platform/xatkit/wiki/Deploying-on-Slack) if needed. More info on [our wiki](https://github.com/xatkit-bot-platform/xatkit/wiki).

Make sure you take the time to read the documentation corresponding to the platform/s used by the bot before trying to run it.

If you have any issue to run your bot do not hesitate to report is on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/xatkit-bot-platform/xatkit-examples/issues)!
